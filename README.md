# SpringBoot-Microservices
# Project: Ekart - SpringBoot Microservices Application

# Microservices Architecture:

Designed and implemented a robust microservices architecture for the "Ekart" application, consisting of key modules such as Account, Address, Product, Inventory, Ccart, Order, API Gateway, and Identity Service.
# Security Implementation:

Ensured end-to-end security by incorporating comprehensive security measures across the microservices ecosystem.
Implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms to safeguard sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access.

# Distributed Configuration and Service Discovery:

Utilized Consul for efficient distributed configuration management, enabling seamless configuration updates across microservices without service interruption.
Implemented Consul's service discovery feature to facilitate automatic service registration and dynamic routing, enhancing application scalability and fault tolerance.

# Resilience and Monitoring:

Integrated resilience patterns and circuit breakers to enhance application reliability and fault tolerance.
Incorporated Prometheus for collecting detailed application metrics, allowing real-time monitoring of key performance indicators and identifying potential bottlenecks.
Developed a Grafana dashboard to visualize application statistics, providing insights into system health, resource utilization, and user activity.

# Database and Technology Stack:

Employed MySQL as the primary database system to store and manage data across various microservices.
Leveraged SpringBoot to streamline development, promote code reusability, and ensure a consistent programming model throughout the project.
This project showcases my proficiency in designing, developing, and deploying complex microservices-based applications using SpringBoot, implementing robust security measures, integrating distributed configuration management and service discovery, and setting up advanced monitoring and metrics systems for enhanced performance analysis.
